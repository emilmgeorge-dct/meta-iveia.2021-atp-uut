Generic MDIO bus over I2C

Required properties :
- compatible : Must be "mdio-i2c-gen"
- reg : I2C address of the device
- #address-cells : Must be <1>;
- #size-cells : Must be <0>;

Must have exactly one child node that is a standard Ethernet PHY device node as
described in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/phy.txt.  The child node's
"reg" property is the PHY address, and must be exactly 0x40 less than the I2C
address of the parent MDIO node.  PHY addresses of 0x10 and 0x11 are not
allowed, because of driver library limitations for SFP compatibility.

Example :

/* Associated Ethernet node */
&gem3 {
    status = "okay";
    phy-handle =  <&phy0>;
};

/* Parent I2C bus of MDIO I2C node */
&i2c0 {
    mdio@40 {
        compatible = "mdio-i2c-gen";
        reg = <0x40>;
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;

        phy0: phy@0 {
            reg = <0>;
        };
    };
};
