# XSA files (formerly HDF)
#

Each subdirectory corresponds to a MACHINE (iVeia mainboard) that contains two
files:
- design.tcl: A block design exported from Vivado
    - To recreate from an open/modified project in Vivado:
        - File -> Export -> Export Block Design...
    - This file is not used by Yocto.  It is only used to recreate system.xsa
- system.xsa: The hardware description file exported from Vivado
    - To recreate from the above design.tcl block design:
        - Run "vivado -mode batch -source design.tcl"
        - Open the resulting project: "vivado myproj/project_1.xpr"
        - Create an HDL wrapper for the block design:
            - From the Sources window
            - Under "Design Sources"
            - Right click "design_1" -> Create HDL Wrapper...
        - Flow Navigator -> IP INTEGRATOR -> Generate Block Design
        - File -> Export -> Export Hardware...
