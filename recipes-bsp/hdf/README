# XSA files (formerly HDF)
#

Each subdirectory corresponds to a MACHINE (iVeia mainboard) that contains two
files:
- design.tcl: A block design exported from Vivado.  This file is not used by
  Yocto.  It is only used to recreate system.xsa
- system.xsa: The hardware description file exported from Vivado.  Yocto uses
  this to generate device-tree and bootloader source.


The design flow is:

    design.tcl  <---->  project_1.xpr  ----> system.xsa

That is, you can:
    - Use the design.tcl to recreate the Vivado project file (XPR)
    - Modify the ZynqMP Block Diagram in Vivado
    - Save your changes by exporting the design.tcl AND system.xsa files.

To recreate the XPR file:
    - Run "vivado -mode batch -source design.tcl"
    - The resulting project is located at: "vivado myproj/project_1.xpr"

To modify setting from Vivado:
    - Open the project: "vivado myproj/project_1.xpr"
    - Flow Navigator -> IP INTEGRATOR -> Open Block Design
    - Double-click the ZynqMP block to edit settings

To save your changes:
    - Create an HDL wrapper for the block design:
        - From the Sources window
        - Under "Design Sources"
        - Right click "design_1" -> Create HDL Wrapper...
    - Flow Navigator -> IP INTEGRATOR -> Generate Block Design
    - Export TCL and XSA with:
        - File -> Export -> Export Hardware...
        - File -> Export -> Export Block Design...
    - Copy the exported files on top of the existing TCL/XSA:
        - Copy myproj/design_1_wrapper.xsa to system.xsa
        - Copy myproj/design_1.tcl to design.tcl
