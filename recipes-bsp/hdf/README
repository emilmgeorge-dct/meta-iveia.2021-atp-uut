# XSA files (formerly HDF)
#

Each subdirectory corresponds to a MACHINE (iVeia mainboard) that contains two
files:
- design.tcl: An block design exported from Vivado
- system.xsa: The hardware description file exported from Vivado

The design.tcl file is not used by Yocto.  However, the system.xsa can be
recreated from design.tcl:
- Run "vivado -mode batch -source design.tcl"
- Open the resulting project: "vivado myproj/project_1.xpr"
- Create an HDL wrapper for the block design:
    - From the Sources window
    - Under "Design Sources"
    - Right click "design_1" -> Create HDL Wrapper...
- Flow Navigator -> IP INTEGRATOR -> Generate Block Design
- File -> Export -> Export Hardware...
